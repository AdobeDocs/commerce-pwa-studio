# Install PWA Studio examples

Learning by example is one of the best ways to absorb the knowledge you need when learning new development tasks. We take that approach to heart and have tried to provide examples that focus on different areas of PWA Studio development.

The PWA Studio team members created these modules for educational purposes. They are not fully tested or guaranteed to work perfectly. However, we do our best to improve these examples and keep them updated with the latest releases of PWA Studio.

You can find all our existing PWA Studio examples in the [pwa-studio-examples](https://github.com/adobedocs/pwa-studio-examples) repo on GitHub.
