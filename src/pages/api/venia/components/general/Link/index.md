# Link

The `Link` component wraps the [react-router-dom Link](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) component, but adds intelligent prefetching behavior to speed up performance. Our `Link` component binds to an `IntersectionObserver` to prefetch the target page's type (such as `product-page`), only when the link is visible in the viewport. And when possible, our Link loads the page information from local cache. And when possible, our `Link` loads the page from local cache to prevent unnecessary roundtrips to the server. In short, the `Link` component builds in all the best-practices that Google recommends when prefetching content for fast transitions.
