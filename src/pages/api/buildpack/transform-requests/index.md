# Transform Requests

The built-in [`transformModules`][] target is a powerful way to customize the build process for a particular file or set of files.
Many common Targets are implemented using the `transformModules` target and a custom transformer module.
Interceptors of this target receive a single function as their first argument. This is the `addTransform` function documented below.
