# Metapackages

With PWA Studio 12.1.0, you can now use metapackages to extend Magento Open Source backends with new features and sample data. As an example, in release 12.1.0 we used the [Open Source metapackage][] to extend the GraphQL schema with a new mutation and a new field providing more information about cart item errors. These packages can be used to add similar backend functionality to your projects.

Available metapackages:

-  Open Source metapackage
-  Venia Sample Data metapackage

## Open Source metapackage (Required for all projects)

PWA Studio release 12.1.0 or higher requires the Open Source metapackage to be installed into PWA projects â€” even if your backend is Adobe Commerce.

See [Install Open Source metapackage][] for instructions.

## Venia Sample Data metapackage (Optional)

You can use this metapackage to install Venia sample data into your projects.

See [Install Venia Sample Data metapackage][] for instructions.

[Install Open Source metapackage]: open-source/index.md
[Install Venia Sample Data metapackage]: venia-sample-data/index.md
