# Metapackages

PWA Studio uses metapackages to extend Magento Open Source backends with new features and sample data. For example, new GraphQL mutations and interfaces enable enhanced frontend capabilities.

As of version 12.1.0, the GraphQL metapackage is required for PWA Studio.

Available metapackages:

-  GraphQL metapackage
-  Venia Sample Data metapackage

## GraphQL metapackage (Required for all projects)

PWA Studio release 12.1.0 or higher requires the GraphQL metapackage to be installed into PWA projects â€” even if your backend is Adobe Commerce.

See [GraphQL metapackage][] for instructions.

## Venia Sample Data metapackage (Optional)

You can use this metapackage to install Venia sample data into your projects.

See [Install Venia Sample Data metapackage][] for instructions.
