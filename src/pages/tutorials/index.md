# Get started

Before you can start developing with PWA Studio, make sure you meet the requirements listed on this page.

## Minimum requirements

- A basic knowledge of [React][]
- Node >= 10.14.1
- Yarn (recommended) or NPM

## Check Node and Yarn versions

Verify your development environment has the minimum prerequisite versions of Node and Yarn installed:

- [NodeJS >=10.14.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn >=1.13.0](https://yarnpkg.com)

Run the following commands in your terminal to identify which versions you have installed.

### Node

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="2" languages="bash, bash" />

#### Command

```bash
node -v
```

#### Output

```bash
v10.15.0
```

### Yarn

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="2" languages="bash, bash" />

#### Command

```bash
yarn -v
```

#### Output

```bash
1.22.10
```

If entering these commands does not show you a version number, install Node.js, Yarn, or both.
