A module that third party code can modify.

When Webpack loads a module into its bundles, it processes the source code
through a set of rules generated by Buildpack. A TargetableModule is a reference
to that source file, meant to be passed to interceptors. Inside
interceptors, extensions and projects can configure the TargetableModule to
transform it in many ways.


* [TargetableModule](#TargetableModule)
    * [new TargetableModule(file, trackingOwner)](#new_TargetableModule_new)
    * [.addTransform(type, transformModule, options)](#TargetableModule+addTransform) ⇒ `this`
    * [.flush()](#TargetableModule+flush) ⇒ `Array.<TransformRequest>`
    * [.insertAfterSource(after, insert, [options])](#TargetableModule+insertAfterSource) ⇒ `this`
    * [.insertBeforeSource(before, insert, [options])](#TargetableModule+insertBeforeSource) ⇒ `this`
    * [.prependSource(insert)](#TargetableModule+prependSource) ⇒ `this`
    * [.spliceSource(instruction)](#TargetableModule+spliceSource) ⇒ `this`
