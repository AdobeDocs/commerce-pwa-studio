# Adobe Commerce PWA Studio

This repository is used to store the code for the [PWA Studio documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/) website. It is built using the [Adobe Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview) and deployed to [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/).

This site contains the latest Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source PWA Studio documentation.

## Contributors

Our goal is to provide the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source communities with comprehensive and quality technical documentation. We believe that to accomplish that goal we need experts from the community to share their knowledge with us and each other. We are thankful to all of our contributors for improving the documentation.

See the [Contribution Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/contributor/) for details about contributing to Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source developer documentation.

## Quick start

For local development, you need to start three servers:

1. **Content server** (your content repo):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts the content server on port 3003.

2. **Code server** ([adp-devsite](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite)):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite
   cd adp-devsite
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Runtime connector** ([devsite-runtime-connector](https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector)):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector
   cd devsite-runtime-connector
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Once all three servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/<pathPrefix>`

For common utilities and documentation, please see the [centralized README](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-utils/blob/main/README.md).
