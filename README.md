# Adobe Commerce Extensibility Developer Documentation

Welcome! This site contains the latest Adobe Commerce PWA Studio developer documentation for ongoing releases.

## Local development

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) project that uses the [Adobe I/O Theme](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme).

To build the site locally:

1. Clone this repo.
1. Install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. Launch the project in development mode.

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Components

To achieve specific user experience goals for Commerce documentation, this repo overrides the original [`Edition`](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme/blob/main/packages/gatsby-theme-aio/src/components/Edition/index.js) component from the upstream [`aio-theme`](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme/) repo that we use as a dependency.

### Edition

The custom `Edition` component in this repo displays a badge indicating whether a feature or functionality is available in specific Adobe Commerce environments. It has been customized to align with the badges that we use in Experience League docs.

#### Usage

```yaml
# Page-level (metadata)
edition: saas # For SaaS-only features
edition: paas # For PaaS-only features
```

```md
<!-- Section-level (inline) -->
<Edition name="paas" />  <!-- For PaaS-only features -->
<Edition name="saas" />  <!-- For SaaS-only features -->
```
